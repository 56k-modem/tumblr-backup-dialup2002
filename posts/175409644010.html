<p>I have a love-hate relationship with remembering that websites used to have MIDI song files embedded in them that would play immediately upon load because on one hand, it so perfectly encapsulates that era to have a shitty approximation of Evanescence scream into your ears at maxiumum volume the second you visited a webpage.</p><p>On the other hand, it lived on in the form of Tumblr blog auto plays and lost the entirety its charm once they became actual MP3s and not computerized booty blast trumpets and the rectal brass section, hell pianos straight from Hell, garage doors being bludgeoned with sledge hammers, a sack of potatoes hitting the ground, and a contender for the absolute worst sound ever produced by mankind (the &ldquo;&quot;guitar&rdquo;&ldquo; &quot;samples&rdquo;) arranged in a charming effort to sound like what aliens would create when given a description of the concept of &ldquo;music&rdquo;.</p>
