<blockquote>
<p>(Sound in the video is NSFW.)</p>
<p>In 1998, Panasonic Interactive Media released<i> Secret Writer’s Society</i>, an educational game that teaches kids how to write. But because of a horrible problem, under the right circumstances in the Macintosh version, the game’s text-to-speech feature would read a list of obscenities.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, it took a few months for anyone to notice this.<i> </i>There’s some dispute about what caused this: Panasonic says it was a bug involving the game’s swear filter, while anti-corporate activist group RTMark claims it was an act of deliberate, internal sabotage meant to raise awareness about the dangers of outsourcing education to a computer game.</p>
<p>This version of <i>Secret Writer’s Society</i> was pulled, and it has been missing for the past 20 years… but this week, I got a copy. And now you can play it too!</p>
