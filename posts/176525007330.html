<h2>sony diskman babey!!! i used 2 listen to old rave cds on it!</h2>
<p>Niiiice! Lol. I had a few CD players in my time, the most recent (and by that I mean ‘I had it in middle school’) one i had was a panasonic and I loved it because I could play those MP3 Cds on them that could hold tons and tons of songs. It was glorious. And then MP3 players came around and rendered it useless, lol, but hey.</p><p>Also, I have a <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/tagged/sony-discman">Sony Discman tag</a> if you’re interested in that kind of content. Won’t lie, you inspired me to make it, lol.</p>
