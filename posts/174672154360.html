<h2>i keep the laptop i had in middle school just so i can play Space Cadet Pinball if i feel like it. what do you miss most about older versions of Windows?</h2>
<p>Ohhh, kickass, that’s awesome! Lol. If I wanna do that I have to download a virtual machine with XP on it. I kinda regret not keeping some of my older machines.</p><p>Part of me just misses the aesthetic. There’s something that really takes me back about those old gray n’ blue windows, how much more simple the graphical user interface was. There’s something charming in how shitty Paint was, too.</p><p> Other than that, though, the sheer amount of fun games. I actually really miss that version of Mahjong you could get for computers running 95/98, I think, called “Taipei”. I used to play that constantly at my grandma’s house because she had no internet. </p><p>I also miss those huge game compilation CDs that were full to the brim of simple, garbage games. I had one called Galaxy of Games and god, I want to play it again so bad. I think I had either the second or fourth one.</p>
