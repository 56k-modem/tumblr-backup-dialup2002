<blockquote>
<p>Another rare game up on the Internet Archive! Although developer MVP Software released free versions of most of the games in their back catalog, only two games in the <i>RoboMaze</i> trilogy were available. The first <i>RoboMaze</i> was apparently only released as a bonus in a commercial bundle.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I had a copy that was sent to me years ago, <a href="https://archive.org/details/RoboMaze_1989_MVP_Software">so I’ve thrown it online!</a> <i>RoboMaze</i> is probably the most coherent and fun of the series, especially with the trickiness of managing your weapons and deciding when to shoot through walls. It’s actually worth playing!</p>
<p>It will run a bit fast in the browser emulator; press CTRL+F11 a few times to bring it down to a reasonable speed.</p>
