<h2>One of my favorite memories from my days as a preteen online was teaching myself HTML on Neopets. It was super intuitive and pretty simple, just adjusting the color values in my bio, or making the text in my signature for the chat boards in italics or pretty fonts.</h2>
<p>Yeah, yeah! I used to do that, too. God, it was like a status symbol for the longest time, eh? Editing your pet pages to be the most extravagant, well-coded and pretty to look at. Some people would adopt more pets just to have more pages, not really caring so much about the pets, but having extra pages.</p><p>I remember when people would start beef which each other, too, and post basically callouts on those pages, too. It was a pretty crazy time, but it was fun to learn the HTML to build your page to make it as cool as possible. Same with the signatures, too, I remember people used to do some really extravagant stuff with their siggies.</p>
