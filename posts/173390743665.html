<h2>i remember when you could download those programs where you could have really cool cursors and have a virtual pet (even though it would probably infect your computer with a virus lmao)!!! i don't think that you can do that anymore and it makes me sad :((((</h2>
<p>Awww yeah! I used to LOVE those. Yeah, they were absolutely bundled with all kinds of backdoor programs and adware but they were so much fun. </p><p>I’m desperately trying to remember the program I used to download all the time that had all of the free cursors. There were tons and tons of them and I believe I was on a machine that was running XP at the time. If anyone has any clue what it was called, I’d be interested to look it up again. I remember they were big chunky stylized sort of cartoony cursors, one of which had angel wings, there was another that was a sandwich with a green olive on a tooth pick on the top&hellip; they were are very cartoony and fun.</p><p>I miss the hell out of those even if the were just malware in disguise, lol.</p>
