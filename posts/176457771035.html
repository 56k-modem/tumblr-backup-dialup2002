<h2>Hi, could you take the Motorola Razr as a request? Those were super popular from like 2006-2008 when I was in junior high. I always wanted one, lol</h2>
<p>Sure thing! This was a blast to look up because it was so damn popular when I was in middle school it wasn’t even funny, lol. Everyone I knew had one, even kids who were as poor as me. Made me mad jealous. <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mpV4avq-0Mp3yp--6jeDoJw">@mni0642</a> also requested this, so I’m pinging them as well.</p><p>I kinda went nuts, so there are quite a few posts: <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457551545">1</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457378240">2</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457320090">3</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457242570">4</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457193180">5</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457153605">6</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457106015">7</a>, <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457091455">8</a>, &amp; <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/post/176457073860">9</a>. As with the others, I have created a <a href="http://dialup2002.tumblr.com/tagged/motorola-razr">Motorola Razr tag</a> as well. Since that’s such a popular phone, I anticipate it will get a lot more content down the road. Lol. Thanks for the request!</p>
