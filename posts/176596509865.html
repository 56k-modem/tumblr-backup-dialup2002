<h2>i played like 12 hours non stop of tf2 with my cousin one day , we used to play all the time , always on the mao stf_turbine, it was so glorious playing as a spy there , if it was to grab the box even better</h2>
<p>Lol, holy fuck. I’ve played so many hours on turbine. I don’t even particularly enjoy that map, but boy howdy are there always people playing it, lol. It is one of the funnest maps to play Spy on, so I can absolutely see why. </p><p>I used to have a very close friend where we’d wake up (in the afternoon, of course, we were fresh out of high school), play TF2, take breaks long enough to grab quick and easy meals and play until we went to bed late into the night. We used to play on ctf_doublecross, cp_orange maps and a few others I can’t remember at the moment. We were even part of a clan at one point, lul.</p>
