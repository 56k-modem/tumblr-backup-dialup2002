<p>Sometimes I spend entirely too much time thinking about the artists who have gone long uncredited for all of these old masterpieces. Artists who made these low-poly, low-frame, glittery, stuttery beautifuly iconic graphics that we collect on blogs like this.</p><p>Especially people who made the really ancient stuff back in the early 90s. Do they realize how far their art has spread? Or did they make one or two gifs/graphics and forget they even did years down the road?</p>
