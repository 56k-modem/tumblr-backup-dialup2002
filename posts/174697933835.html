<h2>I'm so madly in love with this blog, you've done an amazing job- I am a little older than you, at least, I think so- born in 86 and old af but point is!  Did you ever play any FMV games?  I was SO into the FMV Oregon Trail, with the like 2 voice actors and the 6 sprites and the fact that if you just looked at a river someone'd drown.  That, Myst, and the Sims got me through a lot of my angsty teen years tbh.</h2>
<p>That’s really humbling to hear, thank you! I’m really glad you think that way. I’m trying my best to collect everything I can that really embodies that late 90s/early 2000s aesthetic to the best of my ability, it requires some digging at times, lol.</p><p>And yes, you are a bit older than me; I was born in ‘92 and didn’t get a personal computer until 2000 or so.</p><p>I have only played FMV games in recent years, actually, but my god I am in LOVE with them. They perfectly encapsulate the aesthetic of games from that time in the cheesiest way and I adore them. They are my absolute favorite. The Sega CD is a goldmine for that kind of material.</p><p>Nice, lol. I didn’t play much of the Sims, but I used to have a friend bring her Gamecube over and I’d watch her play. I’m nostalgic for it even though I’m pretty sure I’ve never played any of them, myself.</p>
