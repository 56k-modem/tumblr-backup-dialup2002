<h2>Ahh dial up, good times! I had dial up in 2002 and it took me 4 days to download one song from limewire! Love your blog, it brings back good memories!</h2>
<p>LOL, those were the days, eh? I generally used KaZaA instead of Limewire, but I remember using both. Remember when you’d go to download a song given that the file name matched what you were searching for, and then it’d end up being something entirely different (I remember just getting a clip of porn audio once, another time it was a clip of South Park dialogue recorded straight from someone’s TV speakers), or sometimes just nothing altogether? Good times indeed, lol.</p><p>Thank you, btw! I appreciate the kind words! Have a great day.</p>
