<blockquote><p>Why did (most) modern phones get rid of those little holes you can loop charms through? That was brilliant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because the true intent for those holes was to loop a wrist strap through and most modern phone manufacturers would rather see you drop and shatter your phone so then you have to buy a new one. </p></blockquote>

<p>RIP. I figured it was for lanyards, and, in that event I can&rsquo;t see myself ever using it for that purpose (I&rsquo;m sure some people could but I hate wrist straps) so I guess they saw no one wanted to em that way, lol.</p><p>Even so, very sad. You will be missed, charm loops.</p>
