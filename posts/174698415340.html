<h2>I agree with you on that last ask, there's something oddly appealing in how low-fi technology was in the late 90s/early 00s. It's probably just the nostalgia talking, but I kind of miss the gray blockiness of it. Everything is so streamlined now.</h2>
<p>Right? I have such love for lo-fi graphics. That’s part of the reason I’m not big on remasters of old games like Spyro and Crash. I’m hyped that they’re being brought back into relevance, but man, I fucking dig Spyro 1′s original graphics. They’re so full of personality and character even though they’re so low poly. I fucking love them.</p><p>Exactly. Those chunky, simple graphics have such a place and my heart and I’m sure it’s the nostalgia talking. If we were on machines that were that slow with such horrible security flaws, I’m sure we wouldn’t be anywhere near as happy and productive as we are now, but dammit, I just love the way everything looked. I love how washed out certain bitmaps were but they looked so good to us. Graphical dithering? I miss it so, lol.</p>
