<p>I wanted to mention that in that screencap of my desktop where the wallpaper is Vegeta flipping the bird, that wasn’t my own personal computer; I was 13 at the time, so it was our <i>home</i> computer. My mom hated that wallpaper so much she told me outright since she needed to use the computer at times as well, and we didn’t have separate accounts. So every time she logged on the computer to do something, she was greeted to a screencap of Vegeta giving her the middle finger.</p>
