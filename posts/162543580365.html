<p>Wow. I figured I’d break the “silent aesthetic blogger” mold to thank everyone for all the followers this blog has gotten recently! I had no idea so many people would be interested in this blog. Thanks! </p><p>Feel free to send asks, I’m more than happy to talk about whatever. Maybe share some of your favorite nostalgic memories of old internet things? Like maybe some old sites you used to visit when you were younger, but aren’t around anymore, or some old obscure games you used to play.</p>
