<h2>When I was around six-eight years old, I would be visiting the website of Nintendo probably every time it was my turn on the computer to see if there were any new games out. I also have great memories playing flash games (thank god I stayed away from those awful, mature flash games).</h2>
<p>That’s pretty cool. I never really checked Nintendo’s site, but I checked Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to see if they had any new games up. There was also a site run by Nabisco called candystand.com that had Lifesavers golf that I played all the time.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="1280"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_p82deqhWiG1tagmv3_1280.jpg" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="1280"/></figure><p>I avoided mature Flash animations for the most part, too. Although sometimes I’d check them out just to get a laugh.</p>
