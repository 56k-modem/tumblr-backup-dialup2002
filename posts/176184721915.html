<h1>5,000+ Followers</h1><p>I just broke 5,000 followers a few days ago and I just wanted to express my appreciation: when I started this blog I had no clue it would receive so much traction.</p><p>You all are amazing and I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for the support. I&rsquo;m glad to know so many other people appreciate the relics of the past that make me so happy. I hope I can continue to find more nostalgic content for you all to enjoy!</p>
