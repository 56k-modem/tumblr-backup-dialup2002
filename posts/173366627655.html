<h2>Im too young to have experienced the internet from the really early 2000s but I do remember how the very first game I ever played on the net was a barbie dress up game. Then I continued on playing a lot of those actually detailed decoration games with click and drag. One thing that will forever be on my mind were the pixelated sprites with large eyes and amazing designs but then they barely loaded and my young ass didnt realize you cant drag them. (and I thought YT was a forbidden site to enter)</h2>
<p>Ohhh, yeah, I know what you mean. When I was little I didn’t realize you could drag stuff on to the characters in those kinds of games, either. Took me a long time to figure it out, lol. You’re not alone.</p><p>Why’d you think YouTube was forbidden?</p>
