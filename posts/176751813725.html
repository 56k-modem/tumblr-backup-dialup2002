<blockquote><p>Why did (most) modern phones get rid of those little holes you can loop charms through? That was brilliant.</p></blockquote>
<p>My sales at conventions tanked when phones stopped having those.  Ever since people stopped buying phone charms, nothing I’ve made has ever sold as well.  I kept a box of free plug adapters for a while, but when I offered them people reacted like I was trying to jailbreak their fuckin’ iphones.  </p>

<p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mAlckODlYHzBcP-opLoHkpw">@evil-robot-cat</a> That sucks. I considered that when I typed up this post; being someone who’s been to lots of anime/gaming conventions, I remember back when I used to see hand-made phone charms and the excitement I’d get from it. Makes me feel quite bummed out to hear how hard that hit other artists.</p><p>As a few people have commented on this post, they can be looped through certain holes in phone cases (if the person has one) and I’ve seen some that are made to slot into the headphone jack. I’m not sure how easy a part for that would be easy to come across, but that might be a suggestion for you, if you would like to keep selling them.</p><p>Best of luck to you, your art and your sales!</p>
