<p><strong>HALO FAN HAS TO MUCH FREE TIME, MAKES 22 MINUTE FAN MOVIE MASTERPIECE.</strong></p>
<p>Some Halo 3 players might consider themselves patient for collecting all of the skulls or harvesting all of the game’s achievements. Those acts are nothing compared to the dedication that one fan has demonstrated. His video, Halo: Eye of the Storm, is a 22-minute opus composed of hundreds of hours of in-game footage.</p>
<p>Watch the video and then marvel in some of the following facts from the film’s creator, Phillip Kang:</p>
<ul><li>Halo: Eye of the Storm took just under two years to complete</li>
<li>Each shot took an average of 5 hours to capture.</li>
<li>The first 2-minute scene is made up of around 55 shots. That means it took approximately 275 hours to capture. (There are 12 scenes in the movie.)</li>
<li>Halo: Eye of the Storm is the only Halo machinima of its scope to ever be captured entirely in Campaign mode</li>
<li>It was done by one guy working alone (not counting voice actors and titles)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
