<p><a href="https://primordialdream.tumblr.com/" title="primordialdream">primordialdream</a> says: i feel the same way, its like the internet is smaller and theres less weirdness to find in it, which im sure isnt true but i wish having cool webpages and webrings wasnt as uncommon as it is now</p><p>Yeah, exactly, I feel the same way. Technically, the internet has grown, but it feels more claustrophobic, a lot of content has been corralled on to the same websites instead of being strewn across independent websites, which on one hand is way more convenient, making it easier to find, especially for the more casual ‘net users&hellip;</p><p>But for people like us who grew up when it was less centralized, it almost makes browsing feel boring and stale because you’re less prone to finding weird sites by following links in sidebars and paging through webrings, like you mentioned. I’m happy for the convenience factor, but it’s a lot less fun to explore nowadays.</p>
