<p>I think a lot about what it was like to be a child raised by the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s. It was kind of the wild wild west in that search engines were still in their infancy and there were a lot fewer generalized hubs than there are today, so the sites you found were likely to be way different than the sites your friends found. </p>
<p>You were exposed to all kinds of different stuff, more original content. While I understand you still gain exposure to different things like that now in the form of posts on social media, the charm of stumbling across someone’s hand crafted homepage or forum cannot be replicated this way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As someone who grew up on the early internet I can confirm this. Every website had it’s own unique charm to it as well. Now alot of websites look very similar to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly, there’s not a lot of diversity in how websites look, even. They’re all thematic. </p><p>Back then you could go from two web pages that would look entirely different with bright colors and exciting graphics, banners, dividers, and buttons. Obviously, people’s blogs on this website can look pretty different thanks to the themes mechanic but that’s as close as we really get. All Facebook, Twitter and Instagram profiles look exactly the same. It’s all very dull.</p>
