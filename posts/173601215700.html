<blockquote>
<p>The IBM logo throughout the years.</p>
<p>My uncle worked at IBM. He didn’t seem to know a lot about computers, oddly enough; in fact, I’m not even sure what he did there.</p>
<p>He was a big fan of Monty Python. He would act out their sketches line by line, laughing all the time. A real chore if you don’t like Monty Python, or IBM employees.</p>

<p>Actually, now that I think about it, I think he was their accountant.</p>
