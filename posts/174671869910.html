<h2>what's the first video game you remember playing? for me it was Word Rescue on the computer at my preschool.</h2>
<p>Ohhh boy, that’s a tough question to answer for sure, lol. </p><p>The earliest game I remember playing at my school was probably Oregon Trail, although I do also remember playing things like Word and Number Munchers Reader Rabbit, the old Carmen Sandiego game, and some others. It had to be one of those, because we didn’t get a computer in my home until I was 10 or so. I can’t remember which one was absolutely the first.</p><p>I also have some memories of being real little and playing the original Super Mario Bros. for the NES and Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 for the Genesis. I can’t remember which came first, tbh.</p><p>I didn’t play Word Rescue, but I bet it would’ve been bomb at the time.</p>
