<h2>I have a faint memory of my dad calling me into the "computer room" in our house, to watch Neil Cicierega's Bader video on our huge, clunky 2003 computer with Windows 95. A simpler time.</h2>
<p>LOL, oh wow, that’s awesome. My dad never showed me like that, but now I figure is a good time to tell one of my favorite net nostalgia stories.</p><p>So, back when we did have a “computer room” in our house (AKA the dining room), dad kinda had a monopoly on the computer, but I was allowed to use it whenever he wasn’t. Mom didn’t like it so she didn’t use it. My dad mostly played online Yahoo! games like card games and checked NASCAR stats and stuff, but, do you know what I remember in particular?</p><p>My dad actually downloaded the infamous, the dreaded- <i>Bonzi Buddy</i>. To this day, I remember his text-to-speech voice so clearly, because every time I got on the computer, that grape ape was waiting for me.</p><figure data-orig-height="127" data-orig-width="156"><img src="../media/tumblr_inline_pa2p3rzDBu1tagmv3_540.gif" data-orig-height="127" data-orig-width="156"/></figure><p>Even at the time I knew my dad had made a mistake. I’m pretty sure we couldn’t get him off that machine and he stayed until we upgraded. Cursed. My dad cursed us.</p>
