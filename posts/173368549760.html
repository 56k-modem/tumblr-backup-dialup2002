<p><a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/mQSreeg2Csa0lC0H1sOIt2g">@artflicker</a> said: my middle school and teachers also advised us not to use YouTube, probably because of the&hellip;crude content that was freely available there. I still used it to watch CDI YTPs. :D (which were often pretty crude but fucc the rules)</p><p>Oh, yeah? Huh, that’s interesting. Nobody ever gave those advisories to me, that’s an interesting thing. I used to watch CDI YTPs, too. Back when I was about 15 - 17 I was real big into YTP. I guess now that you’ve got me thinking about it, Happy Tree Friends and stuff like that isn’t the best for kids, huh? Lol.</p>
