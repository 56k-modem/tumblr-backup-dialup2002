<p><a href="http://obscuritory.tumblr.com/post/180086089712/heaven-earth-the-obscuritory" class="tumblr_blog">obscuritory</a>:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>
The joy of solving a puzzle in <i>Heaven &amp; Earth</i> is the joy of
 finding balance. The mind-bending illusions put you in a place of 
uncertainty and confusion. Completing a puzzle is rewarding because it 
brings you stability. Look at the puzzle Gaining Losing, where you 
control multiple pieces at once, and to succeed, you have to allow some 
of them to fall away. It can be difficult to adjust to this new role and
 to fit into the odd spaces it gives you, both literal and figurative. 
Solving them is a process of personal transformation and acceptance, 
made explicit by the illusion concepts like Changing Bodies and Identity
 Maze. Success feels like an achievement, of course, and also something 
more profound, when everything clicks into place, when you finally come 
to rest and can see how you’ve adapted. It feels spiritual, like you 
found something bigger than yourself.
