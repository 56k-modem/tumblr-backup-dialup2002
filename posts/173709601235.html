<h2>What is the operating system you have the most nostalgia for?</h2>

<p>Hahaha, yeah, I know tons and tons of people <i>loathed </i>ME. Now that I’m older and have done some research I can absolutely see why, but at the time, I didn’t have many issues with it. It was the OS on the machine I spent the vast majority of my time on, so it was my first real exposure to Windows. I didn’t have much better to compare it to, haha.</p><p>Though, now, it’s pretty funny to think about that. I wonder if that’s what kids who grew up with Vista feel like.</p>
