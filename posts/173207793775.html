<p>I think a lot about what it was like to be a child raised by the internet in the late 90s and early 2000s. It was kind of the wild wild west in that search engines were still in their infancy and there were a lot fewer generalized hubs than there are today, so the sites you found were likely to be way different than the sites your friends found. </p><p>You were exposed to all kinds of different stuff, more original content. While I understand you still gain exposure to different things like that now in the form of posts on social media, the charm of stumbling across someone’s hand crafted homepage or forum cannot be replicated this way.</p>
