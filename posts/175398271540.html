<h2>One of my favorite things from the old internet is how long everything took. I had dial-up until 2005. I feel like I appreciated every song, anime episode, or game I ended up downloading because each one took ages. Even doing things like research took a considerable amount of time, so it really felt special when you finally found something that you were looking for.</h2>
<p>I feel that completely! It really was something to cherish when a site finally loaded. I remember getting particularly giddy when the gif I wanted loaded. Everything was more methodical, there was more ritual. Lol.</p>
